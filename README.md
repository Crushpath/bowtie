### Bowtie: Zeroconf admin scaffold for your MongoMapper & DataMapper models

![Bowtie!](https://github.com/tomas/bowtie/raw/master/screenshot.png)

Bowtie reads the information on your models and creates a nice panel in which you can view, edit and destroy records easily.

### Installation

Include it in your Gemfile and update your bundle:

  source 'rubygems.org'
  ..
  gem 'bowtie'
  
Or install it by hand:

  $ gem install bowtie

### Configuration

Mount Bowtie wherever you want by editing your config.ru file, after loading your models. You can optionally include the admin/pass combination for the panel.

  require 'my_models'
  require 'bowtie'

  BOWTIE_AUTH = {:user => 'admin', :pass => '12345' }

  app = Rack::Builder.new {
    map "/admin" do
      run Bowtie::Admin
    end

    map '/' do
      run MyApp
    end
  }

  run app

Now you can go to /admin in your app's path and try out Bowtie using your user/pass combination. If not set, it defaults to admin/bowtie.

### Important notes

Bowtie requires a few gems but they're not included in the gemspec to prevent forcing your from installing unneeded gems. Therefore you need to make sue that Bowtie will have the following gems to work with: 

For DataMapper models: dm-core, dm-types, dm-validations, dm-pager

For MongoMapper models: mongo_mapper

From version 0.3, Bowtie is meant to be used from DataMapper 1.0.0 on. For previous versions please install with -v=0.2.5.
