Silk. Seems to work but need to do a lot of testing yet.

To try out, download and put in /lib in your app. Then in your config.ru do something like:

require 'app'
require 'lib/silk/admin'

app = Rack::Builder.new {
  map "/admin" do
    run Silk::Admin
  end

  map '/' do
    run TugarAPI::App
  end
}

run app
